Understanding the trajectory of these yields — and the forces behind them — is essential for any investor looking to allocate capital into Dubai with conviction.' },

      { type: 'heading', text: 'The Recovery Cycle: 2018–2020' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The period from 2018 to 2020 was marked by correction and consolidation. Following several years of aggressive supply delivery, Dubai\'s residential market experienced a price readjustment that brought valuations closer to fundamental value. Average residential prices declined by approximately 25–30% from their 2014 peaks, creating an entry opportunity that many forward-thinking investors capitalised on.' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'During this phase, rental yields across prime residential corridors remained resilient — averaging between 5.5% and 7.5% net. This was a critical signal. While capital values corrected, cash flow remained stable, indicating that the underlying demand for quality residential accommodation in Dubai was structurally sound.' },
